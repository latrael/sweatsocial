SweatSocial is a fitness web application with a social media twist!

## Inspiration
We were inspired by the idea of being able to see other people's workouts, and store your own, all centralized on a single website.
## What it does
SweatSocial allows you to create an account and browse through thousands of exercises and workouts. You can filter based on the type of exercise, the muscle group, and the difficulty of the workout. Once you add workouts to your account, you can see them at a glance on the "My Exercises" page. You can find other users on the platform on the "Friends" page, and once you've added a new friend, you can see what workouts they've planned on their profile page.
## How we built it
The main tools we implemented were a NodeJS server, postgreSQSL as our backend, EJS for templating, and CSS for UI. 
## Challenges we ran into
One of the main challenges we ran into was finding an affordable API that returns exercises based on parameters. We were originally going to host all the exercises on the database, but we ended up finding an alternative that worked with what we were trying to achieve.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are really proud of the fact that we were able to start and complete a project, while being confident about the technology stack that we were working with. We had an idea, and we were able to implement it using the knowledge we gained already from class and project work.
## What we learned
We learned to be efficient with our time, as well as being realistic with the goals that we set for ourselves when we first started the project given the limited time we were afforded. 
## What's next for SweatSocial
A calorie tracker was in the original plan for the project, but was sadly taken off due to time restrictions. We would definitely implement that, as well as a way to actually plan a full workout schedule based on the muscle groups the user wanted to work on.
